1. What the code is attempting to do

The code is creating a worker pool using goroutines and channels.
It sends functions (func()) into a buffered channel, and multiple goroutines (workers) continuously read from this channel and execute those functions concurrently.

2. How the highlighted constructs work

chan func() → a channel that carries functions (with no arguments and no return values).

go func() { ... }() → starts a new goroutine (lightweight concurrent thread).

for f := range cnp { f() } → repeatedly receives functions from the channel and executes them.

3. Significance of the for loop with 4 iterations

The loop starts 4 separate worker goroutines.
Each one runs independently, waiting to read from the channel.
This allows up to 4 tasks (functions) to be executed in parallel — i.e., a pool of 4 workers.

4. Significance of make(chan func(), 10)

This creates a buffered channel that can store up to 10 function tasks.
It means you can send 10 functions into the queue (cnp <- func() { ... }) without blocking, even if the workers haven’t picked them up yet.

5. Why “HERE1” is not getting printed

Because the main goroutine exits immediately after printing "Hello".
The worker goroutines don’t get a chance to execute the function from the channel before the program terminates.
When main() ends, all goroutines are stopped.

 To fix this, add a short delay or synchronization:

time.Sleep(time.Second)


or use sync.WaitGroup to wait for workers to finish.
